I don’t know I love her or not but do care about her. I think about her most often. I think about her when I’m very happy. I want to enjoy the moment with her. I want to tell her all the stories. I think about her for hours after watching a beautiful love-story movie. I think about her when I see a beautiful couple walking by my side, seating next to me on a bus holding each other’s hand and putting one’s head on other’s shoulder or giggling in a candlelight dinner. I imagine we could have more interesting and more romantic moments than they were having. 😍😍
I think about her during my hard times too. I wish she’d be with me in such times, hold my hand and say, “It’s okay Sameer. Don’t worry! I’m with you.” I wish she’d encourage me, motivate me and kindly put her opinion to help me make the right decisions. I think she could stop me from being frustrated. She is the one with whom I wish to be when I feel alone, really!🤔
Sometimes I feel like I’m wasting my time thinking about her. She doesn’t show much interest in me. She doesn’t respond quickly. So I try not to respond to her too. I don’t comment, like or react in her posts for a while. I tell myself that I hate her. A monologue breaks previous records again. However, I can’t stop myself watching her ‘My Day’/’My Story’. I, also look at her profile picture and cover photo back to when she started. And, love, again, starts to flourish!💞💞
I think that I think about her because there’s no one else, like a girlfriend or a girl best friend. So, I guess, it’s not love. I think It’s just an affection because she is beautiful, talented and well-mannered. I think it’s an attraction of gender, attraction due to age or something else. It’ll all fade away with time. Maybe, but not sure. 😍
Perhaps I like her. I like her more than any other girls on the list. List?? Yes! I’ve got a priority list and I think most people (esp. singles) have which is absolutely okay in my opinion. I guess she also has the priority list and I ‘m there somewhere in-between. But she has the highest priority on my list. Sometimes she got low priority-value but still not less than others’. 🤗
Whenever I think about having a girlfriend or a wife, she comes first in my mind. She possesses most of the virtues that I expect to have in a girlfriend or wife -I think about 70%.
What about the remaining 30%?? She may do.
I don’t know her well, not close enough. Because we barely talk. Funny thing is that our conversation seems mostly formal. And, we, also haven’t met much.😜😜
For her, if she wants to come in my life, I swear, she will never ever get a single chance to regret on her choice in terms of love, care, trust, and support.😍

But, for now, following around(neither me after her nor her after me) and begging for love doesn’t come in my priority(neither have such intention). I, (I think we), have much more to achieve/contribute in life! Saying that it doesn’t mean I will not give her time or don’t wish to make her special in that classic filmy style. I actually do, in fact, have more romantic ideas/plans. So, I want to walk side by side with her in every ups and down until our grandchildren kiss on our wrinkled faces and close our eyes and say Goodbye! 😊 💘
